# QuotableSlackbot
This project was created as an excuse to try writing my first Slackbot using
the Python framework FastAPI.  And it was an excuse to go look up silly quotes.

## API Endpoints
For now, `GET` and `POST` endpoints run the same code.
Use `GET` to preview result in a browser and `POST` is for Slack
- GET and POST `/random` select a random quotation
- GET and POST `/aypwip` (short for _are you pondering what I'm pondering?_)
- GET and POST `/futurama` (Futurama quotes)
- GET and POST `/zappbrannigan` (Futurama quotes)
- GET and POST `/bender` (Futurama quotes)
